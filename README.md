# AWS Billing Block Assignment Exporter

This Python script retrieves AWS account details and their billing block assignments from the CloudHealth API. It merges the data with customer information and exports everything into a clean CSV file.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Automatically fetches all AWS accounts and billing block assignments.
- Resolves customer names via the CloudHealth Customer API.
- Combines metadata like account name, owner ID, block type, and more.
- Outputs a clean, labeled CSV file.
- Automatically sets up a virtual environment and installs dependencies if needed.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- A valid CloudHealth API key
- Internet access

## üîß Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-billing-exporter.git
cd aws-billing-exporter
````

### 2. Add your CloudHealth API Key

Edit the script and replace:

```python
HEADERS = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
     "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>"  # Replace <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE> with your actual CH API key
}
```

### 3. Run the script

```bash
